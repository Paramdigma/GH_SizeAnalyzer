The problem comes when a user starts to internalize <strong>too much data</strong> inside different Grasshopper parameters within a document.</p><p>As a Grasshopper document grows, the internalized data can start <strong>slowing down</strong> the auto-save process, as it needs to save all that internal data too! This appears to the user as a delay between any change of component wires, which freezes Grasshopper for a perceptible amount of time.</p><p>The problem becomes even more frustrating because by the time you realize this, you may have dozens of nodes that need manual checking to identify which ones have to be slimmed down.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">ðŸ’¡</p><p>This is not a flaw on McNeel&#39;s side, it was just never designed to store a lot of data within the Grasshopper document.</p></div><h2 id="previous-solutions" tabindex="-1">Previous solutions <a class="header-anchor" href="#previous-solutions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="de-activate-auto-save" tabindex="-1">De-activate auto-save <a class="header-anchor" href="#de-activate-auto-save" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A quick search on McNeel&#39;s forum returns several user&#39;s bumping into this throughout the years, with the overall recommendation being to <strong>deactivate auto-save</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://discourse.mcneel.com/search?q=grasshopper%20autosave%20slow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://discourse.mcneel.com/search?q=grasshopper autosave slow</a></p><p>This recommendation is a recipe for disaster, as surely some work will be lost at some point of that document&#39;s history due to the fact that auto-save was disabled in pro of usability.</p><h3 id="reference-data-instead-of-internalizing" tabindex="-1">Reference data instead of internalizing <a class="header-anchor" href="#reference-data-instead-of-internalizing" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>You can prevent the auto-save from slowing down if instead the data is stored in an outside source, which can be a Rhino document, or a plain old text file.
