# Installing

::: tip :bulb: Note:
The version of this plugin is compatible with Rhino `version 7.13` or later (Recommended)
:::
There are two different ways to install the plugin. With Rhino 7 the packager manager makes it easier to install plugins from the server. However the old traditional way is always a valid option :smile:

### Package Manager

### Copy/Paste .gha file

This is the copy/paste installation content

::: tip :bulb: TIP:
Before running Rhino, since the component is distributed from another computer, windows might block it to secure your computer. In this case the component will not be activated. In order to unblock it, `Right-click` > `Properties` on the `GH_SizeAnalyzer.gha` file itself and check the unblock box.
